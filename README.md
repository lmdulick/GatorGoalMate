# Team Mission
Problem Statement: Many UF students struggle to stay accountable and motivated in achieving their academic, personal, and fitness goals each semester. Without a supportive community and effective tools to track progress, students often find themselves falling short of their aspirations.

Proposed Solution: GatorGoalMate, a social media website designed specifically for UF students to tackle these challenges head-on, provides a platform where students can set, track, and achieve their goals while fostering rich community involvement that uplifts and motivates peers to reach their full potential.

Stakeholders: UF Students

Unique Approach:
1. Tailored to UF Students 
2. Accountability through Social Engagement
3. Tangible Evidence to Track Progress
4. Dopamine-Rich Social Media Atmosphere
